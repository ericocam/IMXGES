It's quite small but it already has everything I need and I never find myself struggling for a place to put things. I don't spend much time at my desk so it's okay that it's in my bedroom too.\n</p>\n<p>As time goes on and my workload increases, I will probably start looking for somewhere else to get set up. It's nice to seperate work space from sleeping space sometimes. I wouldn't want to feel like I spend my whole life in my room haha.</p>\n<p>I'm a web developer and most of my work is done in the office. I prefer to work in the office because we collaborate in a small team a lot right now and it's covenient to just call across the office to discuss ideas. Zoom is okay but interaction is a bit too lacking for me.</p>\n\n    <img\n      src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XOZ8p3K.jpg\"\n      alt=\"IMXGES essay example 1\"\n      style={{\n        display: \"block\",\n        marginLeft: \"auto\",\n        marginRight: \"auto\",\n        width: \"100%\"\n      }}\n    />\n\n    <p>That's an example of my work. It has been one of my favourite projects so far. The pacing was just right and we had a lot of freedom to try things that we normally wouldn't, which the client loved.</p>\n\n    {/* <hr /> */}\n\n    <h2>Breakdown of my equipment</h2>\n    <p>I'll take you through all the major parts of my setup and why I have them...</p>\n\n    <h3 style={{color:\"steelBlue\", marginBottom:\"12px\"}}>Macbook Pro</h3>\n    <p>I got the smaller screen size and went with this one over the air because I wanted to keep it for a few years without needing to upgrade for a while. It's a few years old now so definitely not brand new but I love it and it still does everything I want it to. I've been struggling for storage recently but that's my own fault. I should really delete the files I don't need anymore or archive them somewhere.</p>\n\n    <h3 style={{color:\"steelBlue\", marginBottom:\"12px\"}}>Desk</h3>\n    <p>I needed a desk to fit in my room without taking up too much space. I didn't want to waste too much time looking for one so I measured the space and almost picked the first white desk I found with the right dimensions. There isn't much to it and it does the job. In hind sight, I probably should have spent more time looking for one because I've sat at some pretty bad desks in my time but I got lucky I guess.</p>\n\n    <h3 style={{color:\"steelBlue\", marginBottom:\"12px\"}}>Lamp</h3>\n    <p>The window is on the other side of the room which is a little frustrating but I miss out on blinding sunlight in my eyes at certain parts of the day. The lamp is to fill in the gaps when I need it. It gives some ambient light to hopefully protect my eyes from staring at a bright screen when it gets a bit darker. I don't use it much but it's nice decoration. I'm minimalist but the desk would look a little too barren without it.</p>\n\n    <h3 style={{color:\"steelBlue\", marginBottom:\"12px\"}}>Artwork</h3>\n    <p>A little plug for my own work here. I'm technical for work and have a little side hobby I use to unwind. I make artwork. I've always been creative and now that I've got a bit more time on my hands, I'd like to pursue my artwork a bit more. I haven't found my niche yet so there's a bit of everything, I'm working on it. Check it out and buy a print if you like anything.</p>\n\n    <h3>Get in touch with Timothy</h3>\n    <p>Instagram - @timothybenson</p>\n\n\n    {/* <FurtherReading\n      content={\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            <Link to=\"/what-prime-includes/\" style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}>\n              What Does Amazon Prime Include?\n            </Link>{\" \"}\n            - Amazon Prime includes a surprising amout of benefits from free\n            speedy delivery options to access to the Prime Video service and\n            much more\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <Link to=\"/amazon-prime-cost/\" style={{ textDecoration: \"none\" }}>\n              How Much Does Amazon Prime Cost?\n            </Link>{\" \"}\n            - How much does amazon prime actually cost.
